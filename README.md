### Overview
A cross-platform open-source program that equips users with the resources they need to learn chess blindfolded or train visualization.

The program provides a variety of games, from simple ones like moving a knight to a certain square to more complex ones. The program also provides resources like minigames to help the user learn, but ultimately the learning process is up to the individual.
